My solutions to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) questions and interesting questions encountered during real interviews, written in JavaScript.

In each file I will include the description of the problem, my solution with comments illustrating my thought-process and some test-cases to verify the results.

*Note*: I do not intend to do these in order; I will prioritise the problems I find interesting or difficult.
